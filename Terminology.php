                            <p class="font-family text-justify">The floods in Bangladesh are divided into monsoon river flood, flash flood, local rainfall flood and storm surge flood. Monsoon river flood is an annual event forced mainly by intensive river inflow through Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers and rainfall over Bangladesh as causes the water level in the rivers to rise and fall slowly during the monsoon season. Flash flood occurs only in the northeastern Bangladesh in the period pre- to post-monsoon forced by intense rainfall in the Meghalaya Hills and in parts of eastern Bangladesh in the post-monsoon. Local rainfall flood is, as the name states, forced by local heavy rainfall over a location inside Bangladesh. Storm surge flood is a coastal phenomenon forced by cyclones hitting the Bangladeshi coastline.</p>

In a river having no embankment, danger level is about annual average flood level. In an embanked river, danger level is fixed slightly below design flood level of the embankment. The danger level at a given location needs continuous verification as e.g. embankments may be breached, but it is not done continuously by FFWC, whereby some danger levels may be not precise.</p>

To run the Super Model information on water level and rainfall is needed to force the model: water level boundaries are e.g. found upstream in Ganges and Brahmaputra and downstream in Meghna River.

                            <p class="font-family text-justify">
                                Water is the lifeblood of the weather. It moves into the atmosphere as water vapour through evaporation from water surfaces or through transpiration from plants. The vapour condenses in the atmosphere to form clouds and returns to the surface as precipitation (rain, snow or hail) and in small quantities as fog, dew or frost.

                                Water falling on land is destined for one of many fates. If it falls as snow it can spend some time in a snow or ice-field before moving off as a glacier and perhaps eventually becoming part of an iceberg. Or it might melt and join a river. If it falls as liquid drops it might be retained in the soil as moisture for plants, or it might join a river, or be stored for a time in a lake or reservoir.

                                Ultimately rain or snow falling over land will either find its way back to the ocean or be evaporated back into the atmosphere, from where it will move along through various branches of the eternal water (hydrologic) cycle.

                                Bangladesh is one of the most flood prone countries in the world. Due to its location in the low-lying deltaic floodplains at the convergence of three Himalayan Rivers: Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM), heavy monsoon rainfall concomitant with poor drainage often results in annual flooding. These river systems drain a catchment area of about 1.662 million sq. km. The floodplains of the rivers are home to a large population, most of which is rural and poor, and whose life is intricately linked to the flooding regime. Recurrent floods cause widespread damage in rural and urban areas and set back the country's efforts to alleviate poverty.

                                Huge cross-border inflows, low-line topography, deposition of sediment in the rivers, infrastructure development in floodplains have made the country highly vulnerable to flood. As a deltaic land, the ecosystem of the country is water based, and flood is a part of life of the countryís environment. No disagreement that recurrent high floods damage the economy and causes tremendous sufferings to the lives. The reality is that flood brings sufferings to lives for very short time but absence of flood will cause sufferings for much longer. The country needs floods along with the flood coping strategies and flood management provision to reduce damages and sufferings. Flood forecasting is a very effective flood management activity that is being extensively applied in all over the world. In Bangladesh, flood forecasting was started in 1972 through establishment of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) under the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). Institute of Water Modelling (IWM) frequently provides technical support to FFWC for smooth operation and updating of the Flood Forecasting and Warning System. This site describes upon the updates of our endeavor on research in the field of quantitative flood forecasting and warning services.

                                This flood forecasting system is completely numerical model based. Uses several models: Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, hydrological model (MIKE 11 NAM & MIKEBASIN of Danish Hydraulic Institute), and hydrodynamic model (MIKE 11 HD of Danish Hydraulic Institute). Now cast is generated using real time precipitation data where as forecast is generated using precipitation prediction.

                                Under the system, cross boundary inflows into the country are predicted through simulation of the GBM model. The GBM basin model is simulated for 1 year hindcast and 6 days forecast period using real time rainfall and predicted rainfall, respectively. Using the predicted cross border inflows and predicted rainfall, the Flood Forecasting Super Model is simulated within the country for generating flood forecast with lead time of 5 days at 54 stations of major rivers.

                                        The (WRF) model is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. The WRF is effort of a collaborative partnership principally among the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (represented by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the (then) Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

                                        The Ganges Brahmaputra Meghna (GBM) river basin model is developed using MIKE BASIN, the GIS based water resource modelling interface of DHI Water & Environment, Denmark. The model is developed at Flood Management Division of IWM in 2007 based on land terrain data of SRTM, and meteorological data (rainfall, temperature and evaporation) obtained from public domain. Areal extent of the GBM model is around 1,526,733 sq.km: Ganges 979,503 sq. km, Brahmaputra 520,663 sq. km. and Barak (Meghna) 26,567 sq. km.The GBM basin model is tested for hydrological events of 2010-2013.  The comparison plots of simulated and observed discharges at the outlets of basins of the Ganges (at Hardinge Bridge), Brahmaputra (at Bahadurabad), Barak (at Amalshid), Teesta (at Dalia), Dudkumar (Nageswari), and Dhara (Mogol basha) rivers are shown in following figures.
